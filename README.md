Probally not much to put here, but NE0N is a project of mine that i've been working on and its a CLI all based in terminal.

## Installation

Clone this git

```
git clone https://github.com/ne0nclidev/NE0N-CLI.git
```

Then run "NE0N-CLI.py" (in the directory where its at)

``` 
python3.13 NE0N-CLI.py
```

(I would usually run it in terminal, but you can run this script in any software or progam that has/is a Python code executor)

## Notes

if i downloaded this script for the first time, i would find the script in the home directory. I use a MacOS so its called "Home"

For me, i don't need to ```cd``` into the home directory, because when you open terminal, it automatically defaults to home, or ```~```
```
python3.13 NE0N-CLI/NE0N.py
```

Make sure to find the directory on where the NE0N script is, so if you put it in your desktop, then ```Desktop/NE0N-CLI.py```. It will usually be in your home directory.
